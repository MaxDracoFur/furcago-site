  description: "Suit up at 5pm and scamper over to the Music Box Theatre for a one-of-a-kind screening of Hundreds of Beavers! 
  Join fellow fursuiters and furry friends for a pawsitively hilarious film night. 
  We’ll be filling the historic theater with tails, ears, and cheers as we celebrate this chaotic critter comedy in full fuzzy fashion. 
  Don your suit, grab your friends, and let’s turn the Music Box into a den of fun! 
  Fursuits are highly encouraged but not required — bring your best beaver energy! (Show starts at 7, we'll be meeting at 5pm to get everyone suited up and ready to go.)"
