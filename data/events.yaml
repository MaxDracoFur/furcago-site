    event_description: "Furcago reconvenes at one of Chicago’s nerdiest bars — DMen Tap! Grab a table, chow down on mythically good eats (they have good vegan options), and enjoy a night of cozy camaraderie and chaotic good vibes. Whether you're a rogue, bard, or just a sleepy cryptid, all creatures are welcome. Board games and arcade games are available. This is a great spot for newcomers and longtime guildmates alike to connect IRL."
