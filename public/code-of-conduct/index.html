                    <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>This Code of Conduct defines required behavior at Furcago events. All attendees, organizers, volunteers, vendors, and sponsors must comply with these rules in all event spaces, both in person and online.</p>

<h2 id="no-solicitation-policy">No Solicitation Policy</h2>
<p>To maintain the focus and integrity of our event and online channels, we enforce a strict no solicitation policy. Promotion, advertising, or selling of goods, services, or websites without prior approval from the organizers is strictly prohibited. Violators of this policy may be asked to cease their activities and could face removal from the event or online platform. If you wish to engage in promotional activities, please contact the organizers in advance to obtain the necessary permissions.</p>
<h2 id="weapons-policy">Weapons Policy</h2>
<p>The hosting venue reserves the right to deny entry to any attendee based on non-compliance with the weapons policy or any other security concerns that may arise.</p>
<p>Firearms, firearm replicas, and lookalike weapons, including but not limited to airsoft guns, foam replicas, toys like NERF guns, or models, are strictly prohibited within the venue or meet. This policy extends to all firearm types, replicas, and lookalikes, regardless of functionality. If it has the ability to create a projectile, it is not allowed.</p>
<p>The carrying of weapons, either functioning or non-functioning, openly or concealed, is not allowed at any time within venue or meet. This includes any item that could be easily mistaken for a weapon.</p>
<p>Non-functioning, non-firearm prop weapon replicas may be allowed as part of a costume under certain conditions: These props must be crafted from safe, lightweight materials such as foam or cardboard and must not possess any sharp edges. The allowance of such props is at the discretion of the event staff and requires proper peace-bonding. For any clarifications, please refer to our contact us page prior to the event.</p>
<h2 id="media--photography-policy">Media &amp; Photography Policy</h2>
<p>We encourage photography, recording, and social media sharing of content in public spaces as outlined in our Media &amp; Photography Policy.</p>
<p>Respect privacy at all times. Consent is required before photographing or recording individuals.</p>
<p>Organizers may request removal of photos or videos that violate this policy. Violation of these guidelines may result in removal of the content and removal from the event.</p>
<p>Community members with privacy concerns should notify organizers immediately. We will make reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement--accountability">Enforcement &amp; Accountability</h2>
<p>Organizers are empowered to enforce this Code of Conduct at all times. Violations may result in verbal warnings, removal from the event without refund, or referral to local authorities. Serious or repeat violations will result in permanent bans from future events.</p>
<p>Vendors and sponsors are expected to comply with this Code of Conduct. Violations by vendors or sponsors may result in removal from the event space and termination of participation without refund.</p>
<p>Organizers coordinate with venue security and staff to ensure a safe environment. All reports and enforcement actions are handled with discretion.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-violations">Reporting Violations</h2>
<p>Report violations immediately to any event organizer or staff member. Reports can be made in person or via our contact page. Reports will be addressed promptly and confidentially.</p>
<p>Attendees, vendors, and venue staff are encouraged to report concerns directly to our organizers. Our reporting process is confidential, responsive, and respectful.</p>
<h2 id="appeals--resolution">Appeals &amp; Resolution</h2>
<p>Appeals of enforcement decisions can be submitted to the event leadership team via our contact page. Appeals will be reviewed fairly, and decisions will be final.</p>
<p>Furcago organizers reserve the right to make final decisions regarding all matters of conduct, enforcement, and appeals to maintain the safety and integrity of the event.</p>
<h2 id="amendments">Amendments</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct may be amended at any time. Updates will be communicated to attendees prior to or at the start of the event.</p>
